# WHAT IS UNIFINITY?

Unifinity is a blockchain-based educational platform that enables users to leverage the advantages of an immutable, unstoppable, and censorship resistance network. Its participants are able to transfer value peer-to-peer without the help of any sort of intermediary. Through this novel value network, students can be incentivized to perform well.  Imagine students getting rewarded just by attending classes, taking exams and quizzes, and using the Unifinity platform. 

More importantly, Unifinity is a vertically integrated suite of blockchain-based solutions that will facilitate better interaction among school administrators, teachers, students, parents, and alumni, especially in a virtual environment. It allows users to harness the power of blockchain-based applications that are more robust, secure, and trustworthy compared to ordinary, fragmented, and expensive school information systems. 



# EDTECH 2.0: Gamification and Tokenization of The Education System

In a Traditional Classroom set-up, Students are competing with each other on receiving recognition and passing the day to day task and activities inside the classrooms.One of the common issues and time consuming tasks is rating and providing remarks on the students. 
Teachers are consuming extra hours and after school work loads are needed to be allocated by an educator on rating the students; 
Where the Teacher’s work is extended into an extra amount of unpaid hours only to monitor and provide remarks to the students performance, giving them less time on focusing on Quality Learning Materials and lesson plans resulting to poor student’s interaction towards the class and low quality of teaching materials are now presented to the learners. 

Unifinity reward and recognition programs are one method of motivating the users to improve the current workload of an educator by simplifying the remark distribution thru the application while empowering the students to participate more in classes by accelerating their skillset thru the support of Performance Based Rewards Distribution Platform that utilizes the Smart contract and automating the Remark distribution by allocating UNY Points based on the student’s behavior/ activities and completed task which will result to improving their study habits and key behaviors that will benefit the Students and the Teachers.

# DESIGNING A REWARD PROGRAM

<b>The keys to developing a reward program are as follows:</b><Br>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Identification of Institution Activities, Group, Goals that the reward program will support
<li>Identification of the desired performance or behaviors or Actions that will determine the Rewards Distribution
<li>Determination of key measurements of the performance or behavior, based on the set Actions and Marks and Data provided by the institution.

<b>Determination of appropriate rewards </b> <br>

In order to provide the functionalities and benefits, In designing and tokenizing a remark Distribution program must identify the institution's goals to be reached and the behaviors or performance that will contribute to this. While this may seem obvious,Institutions frequently commit the mistake of rewarding behaviors or achievements. Determining the Business Model and goals are highly important to improve productivity. 


Properly measuring performance ensures that the Rewards Distribution reaches the goals. Since issuing an ERC 777 - UNY Points have a real cost in terms of value pegged and locked in the main smart contract. Institutions will need to have 3 levels of authentication and Validation which will be fully automated using the Smart contract to confirm that the activity set and rules of distribution will not be tampered and will not affect the Market Value attached to ERC777.

When Tokenizing a rewards program of the Education Sectors this requires a Design thinking process, heavy researched and deeper understanding on how the behavior and actions of the students in the School interact towards the programs and school activities. Not to mention the Time consuming research and getting the exact data coming from the institutions will be a time consuming task and research to fully analyze how the Token Mechanism will work.

The number of tasks performed and tracking the attendance is such a heavy load on a manual process and sending the remarks to the student’s is a time consuming task that the Educators will need an extra day to finish the reports. 
Normally, Perfect attendance might merit a higher rewardrewards although this is based upon the number of standard school years set by HEi’s. (Higher Education Institution)
It is also important to consider rewarding the level of achievements based on points accumulated of the users accomplishments in order to increase productivity and performance.
